title:  "Hyperion Glossary"
---

I've been reading Hyperion (and now The Fall of Hyperion) by Dan Simmons recently. I was inspired by [this post](https://mechanteanemone.wordpress.com/2013/08/02/lingo-peter-watts-blindsight/) that served as a useful glossary for when I was reading Blindsight by Peter Watts and got inspired to do something similar for Hyperion. This is a work-in-progress and basically just ripped from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I may or may not tidy it up at some point.

- Hegemony
	- ruling government of humans across the Worldweb. Run by a CEO (Gladstone)
- Fatline
	- A kind of FTL communication device. Possibly instantaneous? Something to do with tachyons
- Tau Ceti Center (TC2)
	- Hegemony administrative world
- All Thing
	- Some kind of advisory or opinion gathering thing，consisting of both humans and ais
- FORCE
	- Hegemony military
- FORCE:space
	- Hegemony space military
- Ouster
	- Branch of humans who split off from the rest since old earth died, adapted for zero g, live in the spaces between stars
- Farcaster
	- Portal that allows for instanteous travel
- Worldweb
	- All worlds linked together via Farcasters for instanteous travel between them. Ruled by the hegemony
- Hawking drive
	- Spaceship engine for interstellar travel. Possibly FTL.
- EMV
	- Presumably ElectroMagnetic Vehicle. The main way most people travel on planets.
- Cryogenic fugue
	- Fugue state that is entered in order to skip time during the months/years of interstellar travel
- Treeship
	- Fancy kind of interstellar ship ran by templars
- time-debt
	- The amount of missing time when travelling interstellar. Either by cryogenic sleep or time dilation
- poulsen treatments
	- Treatments to deage (or at least give the appearance of deaging) someone. Expensive.
- Oört Cloud
	- Outer cloud of comets around a star. Up to a light year in radius.
- Ramscout
	- Presumably interstellar ship with ramjet engines that scoop up interstellar matter (e.g. hydrogen) to help produce fuel
- Torch ship
	- ship with torch drive, e.g. high thrust and burn time
- Spinship
	- Appears to be a spin that doesn't necessarily have artificial gravity but spins in some fashion to produce thrust. 'spinout' is when the ship leaves the spin mode.
	- 'spun up to C-plus status'
- Datasphere
	- Sort of like the Internet, but for a specific planet or object. Not connected to the main Worldweb internet
- Comlog
	- personal computer. Wearable in some fashion. Just think of a smartphone.
- Stimsim
	- Recording of someone's sensory input for playback, similar to a movie but far more intense. Taken from Gibson.
- Seedship
	- Ship launched much earlier in history to bring humans to a planet for the first time. Potentially contains human embryos as 'seeds'?
- Hegira
	- A flight to escape danger. An event that presumably when old earth collapsed.
