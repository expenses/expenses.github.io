title:  "Hyperion Glossary"
---

I've been reading Hyperion (and now The Fall of Hyperion) by Dan Simmons recently. I was inspired by [this post](https://mechanteanemone.wordpress.com/2013/08/02/lingo-peter-watts-blindsight/) that served as a useful glossary for when I was reading Blindsight by Peter Watts and got inspired to do something similar for Hyperion. This is a work-in-progress and basically just ripped from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I may or may not tidy it up at some point.

**Hegemony**:
ruling government of humans across the Worldweb. Run by a CEO (Gladstone).

**Fatline**:
A kind of FTL communication device. Possibly instantaneous? Something to do with tachyons.

**Tau Ceti Center (TC2)**:
Hegemony administrative world.

**All Thing**:
Some kind of advisory or opinion gathering thing，consisting of both humans and AIs.

**FORCE**:
Hegemony military.

**FORCE:space**:
Hegemony space military.

**Ouster**:
Branch of humans who split off from the rest since old earth died, adapted for zero g, live in the spaces between stars.

**Farcaster**:
Portal that allows for instanteous travel.

**Worldweb**:
All worlds linked together via Farcasters for instanteous travel between them. Ruled by the Hegemony.

**Hawking drive**:
Spaceship engine for interstellar travel I think what spinships use?

**EMV**:
ElectroMagnetic Vehicle I assume. The main way most people travel on planets.

**Cryogenic Fugue**:
Fugue state that is entered in order to skip time during the months/years of interstellar travel.

**Treeship**:
Fancy kind of interstellar ship ran by templars.

**Time-debt**:
The amount of missing time when travelling interstellar. Either by cryogenic sleep or time dilation.

**Poulsen treatments**:
Treatments to deage (or at least give the appearance of deaging) someone. Expensive.

[**Oört Cloud**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud):
Outer cloud of comets around a star. Up to a light year in radius.

**Ramscout**:
Presumably interstellar ship with [ramjet engines that scoop up interstellar matter (e.g. hydrogen) to help produce fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bussard_ramjet).

[**Torch ship**](https://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/torchships.php):
Ship with an engine that is both high thrust _and_ highly efficient, as opposed to modern spacecraft which are generally one (high thrust regular chemical rockets) or the other (low thrust, high efficiency ion drives). Think the Rosinante from _The Expanse_.

**Spinship**:
Appears to be a spin that doesn't necessarily have artificial gravity but spins in some fashion to produce thrust. 'spinout' is when the ship leaves the spin mode. 'spun up to C-plus status'

**Datasphere**:
Sort of like the Internet, but for a specific planet or object. Not connected to the main Worldweb internet

**Comlog**:
Personal computer. Wearable in some fashion, I guess like a smartwatch.

**Stimsim**:
Recording of someone's sensory input for playback, similar to a movie but far more intense. Taken from Gibson (e.g. Neuromancer).

**Seedship**:
Ship launched much earlier in history to bring humans to a planet for the first time. Perhaps contains human embryos as 'seeds'?

**Hegira**:
A journey especially when undertaken to escape from a dangerous or undesirable situation. Synonym for Exodus. An event that happened when Old Earth collapsed.
